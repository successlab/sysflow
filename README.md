# SYSFLOW

## Introduction
SYSFLOW presents a novel system security development framework for programmable ZT security control of host system activities at runtime. It offers unprecedented and unified programmability for users to achieve their dynamic security needs.

## Dataplane
The dataplane is designed to monitor the system and enforce decisions made by the controller. See deails in [sysflow-dataplane](https://github.com/successlab/sysflow/tree/main/sysflow-dataplane)

## Controller
The controller is designed to make security decisions for each request collected by the dataplane. See details in [sysflow-controller](https://github.com/successlab/sysflow/tree/main/sysflow-controller)
